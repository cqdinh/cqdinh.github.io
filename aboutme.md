### My Life
I am currently working towards a BS in Computer Science on the Data Science track and a BS in Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. As of Fall 2017, I have a 4.0 GPA in my Computer Science courses, a 3.82 GPA in my Math courses, and a 3.718 GPA overall.

I think AI is cool, so I've been experimenting with it in my spare time. 
See my projects <a href="https://cqdinh.github.io/projects#AI">here</a>

I've fallen in love with martial arts over the 13 years that I've been practicing Tae Kwon Do with parts of other styles thrown in.

### Experience
#### UMBC MAPLE Lab
I am currently working in UMBC's Multi-Agent Planning and Learning (MAPLE) lab attempting to implement replanning in <a href="http://h2r.cs.brown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/gopalan16.pdf">Abstract Markov Decision Processes</a> (AMDPs). AMDPs are a way of representing a complex task as a hierarchy of self-contained subtasks. The problem that I'm working on is that because the tasks are self-contained, they do not necessarily know if something has gone wrong until they are done, leading to unnecessary backtracking. 

An example of this is if a taxi picks up a passenger and starts heading towards wherever the passenger wants to go. If the passenger changes their mind about where they want to go, the taxi should immediately change directions and head to the new destination. Currently, an AMDP system would take the passenger to the destination they chose initially before realizing that that is the wrong place to go.
#### Google CodeU
Over the course of the spring 2017 semester, I participated in Google's CodeU program. This career development program consisted primarily of a 3-person group project with a Google engineer performing code reviews as our Project Advisor. In addition, there were three mock interviews so that I could get useful feedback as well as YouTube Live sessions with Google recruiters and engineers that covered various industry and career preparation topics. Finally, in the summer, I went to Google's CodeU Day event at the Googleplex which included talks and networking opportunities.

#### MantaroBot
I spent the summers of 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 interning at MantaroBot where I worked on various aspects of their telepresence robots.

In 2017, I tested a system using IR communication and Arduino to implement automatic docking. In addition, I created an algorithm to model and optimize the movement of a robot arm. This algorithm used forward and inverse kinematics with gradient descent techniques in order to minimize the stress on the armâ€™s joints.

In 2016, I worked on a system for automatic wall detection and avoidance using a Raspberry Pi and a depth sensor that acted like a very low-resolution LIDAR. I prototyped the algorithm in Octave and then finalized it in Python using NumPy and MatPlotLib to analyze and visualize the data as well as to create a simulated test environment.

In 2015, I implemented gradient descent techniques with forward kinematics to minimize the stress on the joints of a robot arm while it moves. The algorithm 

In 2014, I implemented additional communication pathways for the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mantaro.telemerobotappv3">MantaroBot TeleMe Robot App</a> and <a href="http://www.mantarobot.com/telego/">MantaroBot TeleGo Controller</a> to use.
