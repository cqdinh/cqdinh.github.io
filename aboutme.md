### My Life
I am currently working towards a BS in Computer Science on the Data Science track and a BS in Mathematics at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. As of Fall 2017, I have a 4.0 GPA in my Computer Science courses, a 3.82 GPA in my Math courses, and a 3.718 GPA overall.

I think AI is cool, so I've been experimenting with it in my spare time. 
See my projects <a href="https://cqdinh.github.io/projects#AI">here</a>

I've fallen in love with martial arts over the 13 years that I've been practicing Tae Kwon Do with parts of other styles thrown in.
