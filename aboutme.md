### My Life
In Spring 2019, I graduated *magna cum laude* from the University of Maryland - Baltimore County with a BS in Math and a BS in Computer Science on the Data Science track. Now, I'm working towards a Masters of Computer Science at UC Irvine with a particular focus in AI and Machine Learning.
